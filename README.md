# Hey there, I'm Aan! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"/>

I'm a computer science student at unsw and i am passionate about AI and ML. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data structures and algorithms.
- ðŸ’¬ I am always learning and trying to expand my knowledge and technical skills
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm all about non-fictionâ€”my bookshelf is filled with real world magic from quantum physics to groundbreaking tech innovations.
I also never miss a science documentary; theyâ€™re my late night training montage for dreaming big in robotics and tech.
