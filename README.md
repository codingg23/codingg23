I'm a computer science student at unsw and i am passionate about AI and ML. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data structures and algorithms.
- 💬 I am always learning and trying to expand my knowledge and technical skills
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm all about non-fiction—my bookshelf is filled with real world magic from quantum physics to groundbreaking tech innovations.
I also never miss a science documentary; they’re my late night training montage for dreaming big in robotics and tech.
